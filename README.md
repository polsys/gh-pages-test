# gh-pages-test

Checking out how this Pages thing works. I may have some more interesting Pages things brewing.

This repository may be useful as an example of how to set up Pages. The objectives:
* Create pages with Markdown
* Customize the site style
* Try and get MathJax running

### What I've learned so far
* **Paths are case-sensitive.** This is a no-brainer for Linux folks, but I'm a Windows guy.
